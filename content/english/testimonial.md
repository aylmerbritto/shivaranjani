  content : "It was a pleasure mentoring Shivaranjani for 2 years at the Toastmasters chapter of NIT Trichy. She has grown as a successful public speaker over the course of her time in Toastmasters International.

The striking ability of Shivaranjani is her ability to write engaging content. Starting with her ice-breaker speech till her winning contest speeches, she has diligently sculpted every word of her speech on paper, before delivering it on stage.

Next, her ability of constant self-improvement stands out. She takes in constructive criticism after every speech, and betters the level of her performance with every speech. She has improved on all aspects of speaking, be it body language, voice modulation or facial expressions.

She has transformed into a speaker who could deliver various types speeches to a large audience and I am convinced that her diligence, constant self-improvement and speaking skills would be a boon to any team that she is a part of."
