Driven by the idea that being truly passionate about your work motivates you to give your best.

Hi, I'm an Electronics engineer who is also enthused by varied domains such as
- Management Consulting
- Embedded Systems/IoT
- Businesses/Startups
- Ed-Tech space
- Product Management
- Space Sciences

I developed interests across these domains, growing up in different countries with diverse cultures, which eventually led me to meet amazing people from all walks of life! I love reading about anything related to these domains! And occasionally, I also write about my perspectives and favorite reads on LinkedIn.

I've worked with multiple clients and early-stage startups on content writing, strategy & marketing, and business strategy, and have gained experience in the same too! I strive to maintain and challenge the status quo.

At other times, I enjoy binge-reading articles, playing badminton, obsessing over photography, playing the ukulele, or endlessly sharing my adventures at the Kenyan safari!

Feel free to connect if we share similar interests! :)
